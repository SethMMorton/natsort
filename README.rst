Quick Description
-----------------

When you try to sort a list of strings that contain numbers, the normal python
sort algorithm sorts lexicographically, so you might not get the results that you
expect::

    >>> a = ['a2', 'a9', 'a1', 'a4', 'a10']
    >>> sorted(a)
    ['a1', 'a10', 'a2', 'a4', 'a9']

Notice that it has the order ('1', '10', '2') - this is because the list is
being sorted in lexicographical order, which sorts numbers like you would
letters (i.e. 'b', 'ba', 'c').

``natsort`` provides a function ``natsorted`` that helps sort lists "naturally",
either as real numbers (i.e. signed/unsigned floats or ints), or as versions.
Using ``natsorted`` is simple::

    >>> from natsort import natsorted
    >>> a = ['a2', 'a9', 'a1', 'a4', 'a10']
    >>> natsorted(a)
    ['a1', 'a2', 'a4', 'a9', 'a10']

``natsorted`` identifies real numbers anywhere in a string and sorts them
naturally.

Sorting version numbers is just as easy with the ``versorted`` function::

    >>> from natsort import versorted
    >>> a = ['version-1.9', 'version-2.0', 'version-1.11', 'version-1.10']
    >>> versorted(a)
    ['version-1.9', 'version-1.10', 'version-1.11', 'version-2.0']
    >>> natsorted(a)  # natsorted tries to sort as signed floats, so it won't work
    ['version-2.0', 'version-1.9', 'version-1.11', 'version-1.10']

You can also perform locale-aware sorting (or "human sorting"), where the
non-numeric characters are ordered based on their meaning, not on their
ordinal value; this can be achieved with the ``humansorted`` function::

    >>> a = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'apple', 'banana']
    >>> natsorted(a)
    ['Apple', 'Banana', 'apple', 'banana']
    >>> import locale
    >>> locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, 'en_US.UTF-8')
    'en_US.UTF-8'
    >>> from natsort import humansorted
    >>> humansorted(a)
    ['apple', 'Apple', 'banana', 'Banana']

You may find you need to explicitly set the locale to get this to work
(as shown in the example).
Please see the `following caveat <http://pythonhosted.org//natsort/examples.html#bug-note>`_
and the "Optional Dependencies" section
below before using the ``humansorted`` function.

You can mix and match ``int``, ``float``, and ``str`` (or ``unicode``) types
when you sort::

    >>> a = ['4.5', 6, 2.0, '5', 'a']
    >>> natsorted(a)
    [2.0, '4.5', '5', 6, 'a']
    >>> # On Python 2, sorted(a) would return [2.0, 6, '4.5', '5', 'a']
    >>> # On Python 3, sorted(a) would raise an "unorderable types" TypeError

The natsort algorithm does other fancy things like 

 - recursively descend into lists of lists
 - control the case-sensitivity
 - sort file paths correctly
 - allow custom sorting keys
 - exposes a natsort_key generator to pass to list.sort

Please see the package documentation for more details, including 
`examples and recipes <http://pythonhosted.org//natsort/examples.html>`_.

Shell script
------------

``natsort`` comes with a shell script called ``natsort``, or can also be called
from the command line with ``python -m natsort``.  The command line script is
only installed onto your ``PATH`` if you don't install via a wheel. 

Requirements
------------

``natsort`` requires python version 2.6 or greater
(this includes python 3.x). To run version 2.6, 3.0, or 3.1 the 
`argparse <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse>`_ module is required.

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

fastnumbers
'''''''''''

The most efficient sorting can occur if you install the 
`fastnumbers <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fastnumbers>`_ package (it helps
with the string to number conversions.)  ``natsort`` will still run (efficiently)
without the package, but if you need to squeeze out that extra juice it is
recommended you include this as a dependency.  ``natsort`` will not require (or
check) that `fastnumbers <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fastnumbers>`_ is installed
at installation.

PyICU
'''''

On some systems, Python's ``locale`` library can be buggy (I have found this to be
the case on Mac OS X), so ``natsort`` will use
`PyICU <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyICU>`_ under the hood if it is installed
on your computer; this will give more reliable results. ``natsort`` will not
require (or check) that `PyICU <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyICU>`_ is installed
at installation.

Deprecation Notices
-------------------

 - In ``natsort`` version 4.0.0, the ``number_type``, ``signed``, ``exp``,
   ``as_path``, and ``py3_safe`` options will be removed from the (documented)
   API, in favor of the ``alg`` option and ``ns`` enum.  They will remain as
   keyword-only arguments after that (for the foreseeable future).
 - In ``natsort`` version 4.0.0, the ``natsort_key`` function will be removed
   from the public API.  All future development should use ``natsort_keygen``
   in preparation for this.
 - In ``natsort`` version 3.1.0, the shell script changed how it interpreted
   input; previously, all input was assumed to be a filepath, but as of 3.1.0
   input is just treated as a string.  For most cases the results are the same.
 
   - As of ``natsort`` version 3.4.0, a ``--path`` option has been added to
     force the shell script to interpret the input as filepaths.

History
-------

These are the last three entries of the changelog.  See the package documentation
for the complete `changelog <http://pythonhosted.org//natsort/changelog.html>`_.

01-13-2015 v. 3.5.2
'''''''''''''''''''

    - Enhancement that will convert a 'pathlib.Path' object to a 'str' if
      'ns.PATH' is enabled.

09-25-2014 v. 3.5.1
'''''''''''''''''''

    - Fixed bug that caused list/tuples to fail when using 'ns.LOWECASEFIRST'
      or 'ns.IGNORECASE'.
    - Refactored modules so that only the public API was in natsort.py and
      ns_enum.py.
    - Refactored all import statements to be absolute, not relative.

09-02-2014 v. 3.5.0
'''''''''''''''''''

    - Added the 'alg' argument to the 'natsort' functions.  This argument
      accepts an enum that is used to indicate the options the user wishes
      to use.  The 'number_type', 'signed', 'exp', 'as_path', and 'py3_safe'
      options are being deprecated and will become (undocumented)
      keyword-only options in natsort version 4.0.0.
    - The user can now modify how 'natsort' handles the case of non-numeric
      characters.
    - The user can now instruct 'natsort' to use locale-aware sorting, which
      allows 'natsort' to perform true "human sorting".

      - The `humansorted` convenience function has been included to make this
        easier.

    - Updated shell script with locale functionality.
